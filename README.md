### Features

+ Inspecting Regular components hierarchy tree in element view.
+ Inspecting data, filters, directives, animations of selected component in sidebar.
+ Data changes made with Regular components will be reflected in both element view and sidebar in real-time.
+ Sidebar data is editable, changes will be applied to the coresponding component in page.
+ Searching component in element view.
+ Included contents will be annotated with `#inc`.
+ Click `inspect` button to inspect DOM node of selected component in Elements tab.
+ **Pro Tip One**: When inspecting DOM node in Elements tab, switch to Regular tab, if the DOM node you are inspecting is rendered from a Regular component, the Regular Devtools will automatically focus on that component. It's like the reverse version of the last feature.
+ **Pro Tip Two**: When selecting component in element view, the component instance is available as `$r` in your console.
